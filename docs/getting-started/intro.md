# Why Resonate?

Resonate offers a cloud computing model that allows you to build resilient applications using an intuitive programming interface you already know — **async • await**. 

## Dead Simple 

### Coordination 
With a familiar async • await interface, you can create and coordinate distributed services without learning complex failure handling techniques or vendor-specific concepts. On day one, use your existing async • await programming knowledge to build systems that recover gracefully. 

### Integration

:::note
Integration is phase 2 of our [roadmap](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/issues/131). This Integration section aims to highlight the ambition and vision of the product not existing features. 
:::

Resonate is already designed to integrate seamlessly with your tech stack. The next level is to allow you to consolidate the custom cloud computing programming models you are using and greatly simplify coordination across cloud systems by orders of magnitude through the same async • await interface.

## Flexibility 

### Dials of Reliability

The Resonate library offers two reliability modes to meet your needs:
- *Resilient* mode provides medium failsafe protection with progress stored in-memory, for less critical applications or testing. 
- *Durable* mode offers the highest reliability with complete fault-tolerance across application restarts, using the Resonate engine.

You can tune between these two modes like a slider, depending on your reliability requirements.
