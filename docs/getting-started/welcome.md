# Why Resonate?

- Resonate offers a programming model that enables you to build distributed applications using an intuitive paradigm you already know â€” **async await**.

- Resonate embraces the spirit of **open source** and **open collaboration**.

- Resonate's **durable async await** builds on [durable promises](/reference/durable-promises.md), an open standard with a minimal and accessible API.

# Durable async await

Resonate's durable async await, that is, functions and promises that maintain progress in durable storage. With durable async await function executions have an identity that outlives the execution of the underlying function. This simple concept can be used to coordinate processes in distributed applications, implement transaction semantics across disparate systems, and much more.
